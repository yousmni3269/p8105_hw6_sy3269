Necessary packages such as `tidyverse` and `readr` for this homework was
loaded.

## Problem 1

The weather data required for problem 1 was imported as specified in the
P8105 website.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

Using the `tmax` as the response and `tmin` as the predictor,
bootstrapping was performed and estimates for 𝑟̂2 and log(𝛽̂0∗𝛽̂1) for each
bootstrap sample were determined.

``` r
boot_straps = 
  weather_df |>
  modelr::bootstrap(5000) |>
  mutate(
    strap = map(strap, as_tibble), 
    models = map(strap, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = df)), 
    results_tidy = map(models, broom::tidy),
    results_glance = map(models, broom::glance)
  ) |>
  select(.id, results_tidy, results_glance) |>
  unnest(results_tidy, results_glance)
```

    ## Warning: `unnest()` has a new interface. See `?unnest` for details.
    ## ℹ Try `df %>% unnest(c(results_tidy, results_glance))`, with `mutate()` if
    ##   needed.

  summarize(log_b0_b1 = log(prod(estimate)), .groups = "drop")

Then, the distribution of the estimates for 5000 bootstrap sample was
plotted. The distribution is approximately normal, being symmetric with
respect to 1.04.

``` r
boot_straps |>
  filter(term == "tmin") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) + 
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "Estimate", 
       y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of the estimates") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw6_sy3269_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to
provide a 95% confidence interval for 𝑟̂2 and log(𝛽̂0∗𝛽̂1) were also
found.The confidence interval is (1.005, 1.073).

``` r
boot_straps |>
  filter(term == "tmin") |> 
  summarize(
    lower = quantile(estimate, probs = 0.025),
    upper = quantile(estimate, probs = 0.975) 
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

## Problem 2

The homicides data gathered by The *Washington Post* in 50 large U.S.
cities was imported and cleaned. An additional variable `city_state` was
added to show both city and state information in one vector, and a
binary variable called `solved` was added to show cases closed with
arrest as 1 and the others (closed without arrest and open cases) as 0.

Some cities that do not report victim race, such as Dallas, TX; Phoenix,
AZ; and Kansas City, MO were omitted, and a data entry with incorrect
information (e.g. Tulsa, AL) was also omitted. Data with unknown
victim_age or victim_sex were also omitted for analysis. The analysis
will be limited to the victims whose race is white or black.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("NA", "", ".")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "), 
         solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)
  ) |>
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"), 
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"), 
         victim_age != "Unknown", 
         victim_sex != "Unknown") |>
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.

For the city of Baltimore, MD, the glm function was used to fit a
logistic regression with `solved` as the outcome and `victim_age`,
`victim_sex` and `victim_race` are predictors. The output of glm
function was saved, cleaned using the broom::tidy, and the estimate and
confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims, with all the other variables
fixed, were found.

``` r
baltimore_model = 
  homicide_data |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _) |>
  broom::tidy()

baltimore_model |>
  filter(term =="victim_sexMale") |>
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
    conf_int_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error), 
    conf_int_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) |>
  select(term, estimate, odds_ratio, conf_int_lower, conf_int_upper) |>
  knitr::kable(digit = 3)
```

| term           | estimate | odds_ratio | conf_int_lower | conf_int_upper |
|:---------------|---------:|-----------:|---------------:|---------------:|
| victim_sexMale |   -0.204 |      0.816 |          0.766 |          0.868 |

Then, for each of the 50 cities, the adjusted odds ratio and confidence
interval for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
were calculated.

``` r
city_model = function(name) { 
  
  city_data = 
    homicide_data |>
    filter(city_state == name) 
    
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = city_data) |>
    broom::tidy()
}

unique_city_state = 
  homicide_data |>
  distinct(city_state) |>
  pull(city_state)

city_simulation = 
  tibble(
    unique_name = unique_city_state
  ) |>
  mutate(data = map(unique_name, city_model)) |>
  unnest(data) 

city_simulation |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
    conf_int_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error), 
    conf_int_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) |>
  select(unique_name, estimate, odds_ratio, conf_int_lower, conf_int_upper) |>
  knitr::kable(digit = 3)

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

``` r
birthweight_data |>
  lm(bwt ~ wtgain + delwt, data = _)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ wtgain + delwt, data = birthweight_data)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ## (Intercept)       wtgain        delwt  
    ##    2207.798        7.135        5.146

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.
